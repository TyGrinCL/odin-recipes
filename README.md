# Odin Recipes

Creating a webpage listing various recipes to show of my HTML skills

## Description

The purpose of this project is to show off the HTML that I have learned, including lists, links, images, etc. I am doing so by building a webpage acting as a recipe homepage that will have links to other pages that include recipes. The index page links to three recipes: a loaded baked potato, sirloin steak, and apple pie.

## Features

*   Feature 1: Index page with links to all other recipe pages
*   Feature 2: Each recipe page links to the next/previous recipe, as well as the homepage.
*   Feature 3: Images on all pages, with links to the original recipes.
