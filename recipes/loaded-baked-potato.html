    <p>Below, you will see all the ingradients needed to create your loaded baked potatoes,
         along with the steps to curate your dish</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>(1) Russet Potato</li>
        <li>(1/2 tbsp) Bacon Bits</li>
        <li>(2 tbsp) Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>(1 tbsp) Sour Cream</li>
        <li>(1 tbsp) Butter</li>
        <li>(1/2 tbsp) Chives</li>
        <li>(1 1/2 tsp) Salt</li>
        <li>(1/2 tsp) Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Place one oven rack on the upper third and another rack on the lower third.
             Scrub the potatoes clean, dry them, then prick them all over with a fork.</li>

        <li>Place the potatoes on a baking sheet. Rub them all over with the oil, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the salt,
             and bake on the lower rack until thoroughly cooked and soft in the center, about 1 hour.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with foil. Spread the bacon in a single layer on the baking sheet and
             bake on the upper rack, flipping halfway through, until crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the bacon
              to a paper towel-lined plate and finely crumble when cool enough to handle.</li>

        <li>Cut a slit lengthwise in the top of each potato and pinch it open. Add 1 tablespoon butter and some
             pepper to each potato. Divide the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt evenly between the potatoes,
              and use a fork to mash the filling without breaking the skin shell.</li>

        <li>Serve the potatoes with the cheddar, sour cream, bacon, and chives, for topping.</li>
    </ol>
